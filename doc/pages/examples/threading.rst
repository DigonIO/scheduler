Threading
=========

The |Scheduler| is thread safe and supports parallel execution
of pending |Job|\ s.
|Job|\ s with a relevant execution time or blocking IO operations
can delay each other.

.. warning:: When running |Job|\ s in parallel, be sure that possible side effects
    of the scheduled functions are implemented in a thread safe manner.

The following examples show the difference between concurrent and parallel
|Scheduler|\ s:

Concurrent execution
--------------------

By default the |Scheduler| will execute its
|Job|\ s sequentially. The total duration when executing multiple
|Job|\ s will therefore be greater than the sum of the individual
run times.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import datetime as dt
    >>> import time

    >>> from scheduler import Scheduler

    >>> def sleep(secs: float):
    ...     time.sleep(secs)
    ...

    >>> schedule = Scheduler()
    >>> job_1 = schedule.once(dt.timedelta(), sleep, kwargs={"secs": 0.1})
    >>> job_2 = schedule.once(dt.timedelta(), sleep, kwargs={"secs": 0.1})

    >>> start_time = time.perf_counter()
    >>> n_exec = schedule.exec_jobs()
    >>> total_seconds = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    >>> n_exec
    2

    >>> 0.2 < total_seconds and total_seconds < 0.21
    True

Parallel execution
------------------

The number of worker threads for the |Scheduler| can be defined
with the `n_threads` argument. For ``n_threads = 0`` the |Scheduler|
will spawn a seperate worker thread for every pending |Job|.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import datetime as dt
    >>> import time

    >>> from scheduler import Scheduler

    >>> def sleep(secs: float):
    ...     time.sleep(secs)
    ...

    >>> schedule = Scheduler(n_threads=0)
    >>> job_1 = schedule.once(dt.timedelta(), sleep, kwargs={"secs": 0.1})
    >>> job_2 = schedule.once(dt.timedelta(), sleep, kwargs={"secs": 0.1})

    >>> start_time = time.perf_counter()
    >>> n_exec = schedule.exec_jobs()
    >>> total_seconds = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    >>> n_exec
    2

    >>> 0.1 < total_seconds and total_seconds < 0.11
    True
